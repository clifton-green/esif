Any development tasks or optimisations which need to be made should be listed here.

**Note:** If there is a task/bug manager in place to cover this then this file will not be updated.

## Tasks:
1. Set up tests (jasmine and casperjs/spooky)
5. Add sourcemaps at some
6. Add javascript validation and custom validation messages to compliment HTML5 validation
7. It would be a nice to have if instead of having to insert a regex patten the user can just add 'postcode' to the validation and it would work that way. This would require adding some sort of find and replace tool to the gulpfile.
8. Add script to accept conditional fields based on classes

## Issues
1. Responsiveness has failed on some templates
2. Pattern validation not working on all inputs (see dateset for an example)
