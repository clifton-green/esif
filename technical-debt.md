Any development tasks or optimisations which need to be made should be listed here.

**Note:** If there is a task/bug manager in place to cover this then this file will not be updated.

## Tasks:
- Install Lodash
- Set up tests
- Add login/logout states and update nav accordingly

## Issues
- The build system ignores JSON updates on watch. It will only work with a manual build.
